# Custom Assembler and Simulator for a Given ISA
This project is a custom assembler and simulator for a given instruction set architecture (ISA) written in Python. The assembler is responsible for converting assembly code to machine code for the specified ISA, and the simulator is used to simulate the execution of the resulting machine code.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
Python 3
