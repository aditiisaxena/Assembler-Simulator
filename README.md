# Custom Assembler and Simulator for a Given ISA
This project is a custom assembler and simulator for a given instruction set architecture (ISA) written in Python. The assembler is responsible for converting assembly code to machine code for the specified ISA, and the simulator simulates the execution of the resulting machine code.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
Python 3
### Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/aditiisaxena/Assembler-Simulator
```
Add the source code file for the assembler in the folder named SimpleAssembler
Add the source code file for the simulator in the folder named SimpleSimulator

Naming Convention for the source files: SimpleAssembler, SimpleSimulator.

### Instruction for the run file
All the run files need to be granted permission/privilege for execution.
Eg. for Linux-systems, go to the folder of each run file using bash/terminal and write:
```
chmod +x run
```
To run the results for your assembler, go to Automated Testing folder and open bash/terminal.
Assuming you have granted required permissions to the run file, type: 
```
./run --no-sim
```
To run the results for your simulator, go to Automated Testing folder and open bash/terminal.
Assuming you have granted required permissions to the run file, type:
```
./run --no-asm
```
To run the results for both,, the assembler and the simulator, go to Automated Testing folder and open bash/terminal.
Assuming you have granted required permissions to the run file, type:
```
./run or ./run --verbose [for verbose output] 
```
